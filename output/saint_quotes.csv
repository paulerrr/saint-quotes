And if the one who was bitten keeps silence and does not do penance, and does not want to confess his wound to his brother and to his Master, then his brother and his Master, who have the word that will cure him, cannot very well assist him. For if the sick man is ashamed to confess his wound to the physician, medicine will not cure that to which it is not applied. Jerome If you want to flee from God, flee to Him instead.

278,"CONVERSION, CONVERTS","A convert is undeniably in favor with no party; he is looked at with distrust, contempt, and aversion by all. His former friends think him a good riddance, and his new friends are cold and strange; and as to the impartial public, their very first impression is to impute the change to some eccentricity of character, or fickleness of mind, or tender attachment, or private interest. Their utmost praise is the reluctant confession that “doubtless he is very sincere.”",John Henry Cardinal Newman,89,A Dictionary of Quotes from the Saints,"A Dictionary of Quotes From th - Thigpen, Paul_6247.pdf"

They are laying hands on God when they try to reform what He has formed.",Cyprian of Carthage,92,A Dictionary of Quotes from the Saints,"A Dictionary of Quotes From th - Thigpen, Paul_6247.pdf"
287,COSMETICS,"Suppose an artist paints in beautiful lines and colors the likeness of someone’s face and form. Then, once the portrait is completed, someone else comes along, picks it up and, thinking that he could do a better job, makes changes in the picture.

And do you think it likely you could get away with acting the same way, with a rash and wicked presumption that offends God—the Artist who created you?",Cyprian of Carthage,92,A Dictionary of Quotes from the Saints,"A Dictionary of Quotes From th - Thigpen, Paul_6247.pdf"

With the Cross, as though with a plow, the disciples of Christ cultivated the unfruitful nature of mankind, revealed the Church’s ever-green pastures, and gathered in an abundant harvest of believers in Christ. By the Cross the martyrs were strengthened, and as they fell they smote down those who struck them.

And I realized that this love was the true motive force that enabled the other members of the Church to act; if it ceased to function, the Apostles would forget to preach the Gospel, the Martyrs would refuse to shed their blood. Thérèse of Lisieux Love … is the vocation that includes all others. Thérèse of Lisieux Love … is a universe of its own, comprising all time and space. Thérèse of Lisieux Love cannot be content without condescending—condescending to mere nothingness, and making this nothingness the fuel for its flame. Thérèse of Lisieux Even a little child can scatter flowers, to scent the throne room with their fragrance; even a little child can sing, in its shrill treble, the great canticle of Love. That shall be my life: to scatter flowers—to miss no single opportunity of making some small sacrifice, here by a smiling look, there by a kindly word, always doing the tiniest things right, and doing it for love. Thérèse of Lisieux Perfect love means putting up with other people’s shortcomings, feeling no surprise at their weaknesses, finding encouragement even in the slightest evidence of good qualities in them.

1220,PRAYER,"What an extraordinary thing it is, the efficiency of prayer! Like a queen, it has access at all times to the royal Presence, and can get whatever it asks for. Thérèse of Lisieux I tell God what I want quite simply, without any splendid turns of phrase, and somehow He always manages to understand me. Thérèse of Lisieux Prayer means a launching out of the heart towards God; it means lifting up one’s eyes, quite simply, to heaven, a cry of grateful love, from the crest of joy or the trough of despair; it’s a vast, supernatural force that opens out my heart and binds me close to Jesus. Thérèse of Lisieux It is true that God’s power triumphs over everything, but humble and suffering prayer prevails over God Himself.",Padre Pio of Pietrelcina,302,A Dictionary of Quotes from the Saints,"A Dictionary of Quotes From th - Thigpen, Paul_6247.pdf"

1223,"PRAYER, INATTENTION DURING","At the time of prayer, let the heart be closed against the adversary and open to God alone, nor let it allow God’s enemy to approach it. For frequently he steals upon us, and penetrates within, and by crafty deceit calls away our prayers from God, so that we may have one thing in our heart and another in our voice—at the very time when not the voice, but the soul and mind should be praying to the Lord with a simple intention. But what carelessness it is to be distracted and carried away by foolish and profane thoughts when you are praying to the Lord, as if there were anything that you should rather be thinking of than to think of talking to God!",Cyprian of Carthage,303,A Dictionary of Quotes from the Saints,"A Dictionary of Quotes From th - Thigpen, Paul_6247.pdf"

1225,"PRAYER, INATTENTION DURING","If someone, simply as an experiment, should try with determination to make his mind touch on as many and as diverse objects as possible, I hardly think that in so short a time he could run through such diverse and numerous topics as the mind, unrestrained, wanders through while the mouth negligently mutters through the most common prayers.",Thomas More,303,A Dictionary of Quotes from the Saints,"A Dictionary of Quotes From th - Thigpen, Paul_6247.pdf"
1226,"PRAYER, INATTENTION DURING","Our minds do not go wandering while we address an earthly prince about some important matter or even while we speak to one of his ministers who might hold a position of some influence with his master.

1227,"PRAYER, INATTENTION DURING","What I only aim at is this: that we see Him, and remain with Him, to whom we are speaking, without turning our backs on Him.

1231,"PRAYER, POSTURE IN","I would insist that, besides the prayers we may say through the day while walking, we also should occasionally say some prayers for which we have prepared our minds more thoughtfully, for which we have disposed our bodies more reverently, than we would if we were about to approach all the rulers in the whole world seated together in one place.",Thomas More,304,A Dictionary of Quotes from the Saints,"A Dictionary of Quotes From th - Thigpen, Paul_6247.pdf"

1242,PRAYER AND ACTION,"Jacob’s ladder … is a faithful representation of the devout life. The two sides between which we ascend, and which support the steps, are prayer, which bring the love of God, and the Sacraments that confer it. The steps are but the various degrees of charity by which we advance from virtue to virtue, either descending in action to the aid of our neighbor, or ascending in contemplation to a loving union with God.",Francis de Sales,307,A Dictionary of Quotes from the Saints,"A Dictionary of Quotes From th - Thigpen, Paul_6247.pdf"

1247,PRAYER VIGILS,"If we give ourselves to meditation and prayer in the dark silence of the night, the soul, collected, will discover that it is much more open to divine consolation than it is during the daytime, when the noise of business all around distracts the eyes, the ears, and the mind, and dissipates our energy in countless activities that are as meaningless as they are varied.",Thomas More,308,A Dictionary of Quotes from the Saints,"A Dictionary of Quotes From th - Thigpen, Paul_6247.pdf"

1251,PRAYERLESSNESS,"The man who doesn’t pray is like a chicken or a turkey, which can’t rise into the air. They may fly a little, but they soon have to come down, they scratch the earth and get deeper and deeper in it, they cover their heads with it and they don’t seem to take pleasure in anything else. The man who prays, on the other hand, is like a fearless eagle, and seems always to want to get closer to the Sun.",John Vianney,309,A Dictionary of Quotes from the Saints,"A Dictionary of Quotes From th - Thigpen, Paul_6247.pdf"

1587,SUFFERING,"Do as the merchant does with his merchandise: Make a profit on every item. Don’t allow the loss of the tiniest fragment of the true cross. It may be only the sting of a horsefly or the prick of a pin that annoys you; it may be a neighbor’s little eccentricities, some unintended slight, the insignificant loss of a penny, some small restlessness of soul, a light pain in your limbs.

1611,"TEACHERS, TEACHING","It is dangerous for a man to try teaching before he is trained in the good life. A man whose house is about to fall down may invite travelers inside to refresh them, but instead they are hurt in the collapse of the house.
