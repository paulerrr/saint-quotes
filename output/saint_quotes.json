By the Cross the martyrs were strengthened, and as they fell they smote down those who struck them.

Thérèse of Lisieux Love cannot be content without condescending—condescending to mere nothingness, and making this nothingness the fuel for its flame. Thérèse of Lisieux Even a little child can scatter flowers, to scent the throne room with their fragrance; even a little child can sing, in its shrill treble, the great canticle of Love. That shall be my life: to scatter flowers—to miss no single opportunity of making some small sacrifice, here by a smiling look, there by a kindly word, always doing the tiniest things right, and doing it for love. Thérèse of Lisieux Perfect love means putting up with other people’s shortcomings, feeling no surprise at their weaknesses, finding encouragement even in the slightest evidence of good qualities in them.

Thérèse of Lisieux I tell God what I want quite simply, without any splendid turns of phrase, and somehow He always manages to understand me. Thérèse of Lisieux Prayer means a launching out of the heart towards God; it means lifting up one’s eyes, quite simply, to heaven, a cry of grateful love, from the crest of joy or the trough of despair; it’s a vast, supernatural force that opens out my heart and binds me close to Jesus. Thérèse of Lisieux It is true that God’s power triumphs over everything, but humble and suffering prayer prevails over God Himself.",

For frequently he steals upon us, and penetrates within, and by crafty deceit calls away our prayers from God, so that we may have one thing in our heart and another in our voice—at the very time when not the voice, but the soul and mind should be praying to the Lord with a simple intention. But what carelessness it is to be distracted and carried away by foolish and profane thoughts when you are praying to the Lord, as if there were anything that you should rather be thinking of than to think of talking to God!",
